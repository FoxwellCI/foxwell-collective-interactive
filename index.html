            <p>
                Foxwell Collective Interactive is an indie studio composed of only two people.
                Both collaborators are responsible for concept art, writing, story development
                and character creation.
            </p>

            <p>
                By choice, the members of the studio prefer not to reveal their real identities
                at this time. Privacy and security are absolute priorities, valued above public
                exposure or individual recognition.
            </p>

            <p>
                The studio is led by <strong>Pol</strong>, publicly known as
                <strong>QuietPollen</strong>, who serves as the Lead Developer and primary
                coordinator of the project. This role is fulfilled under a separate public
                profile that does not contain personal or identifying information.

            <h2>Current Project</h2>
            <p>
                The studio already has a project that is nearly complete in terms of narrative
                structure, universe, characters and gameplay planning.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is a narrative-driven horror game within the Mascot Horror genre, focused on
                emotional immersion, direct interaction with characters and psychological tension
                rather than explicit gore.
            </p>

            <p>
                The expected release window is between 2026 and 2027, allowing the necessary time
                for creative refinement and overall quality.

            <h2>Studio Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                Foxwell Collective Interactive believes that the most impactful horror does not rely
                solely on visual shock, but on emotional connection, quiet discomfort and the
                narrative consequences of the player's choices.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each project is treated as an authorial experience, where narrative, atmosphere
                and characters work together to create memorable and unsettling endings.
            </p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <h3>What is Foxwell Collective Interactive?</h3>
            <p>
                It is an indie studio focused on creating narrative horror games, with a strong
                emphasis on story, characters and psychological immersion.
            </p>

            <h3>How many people are part of the studio?</h3>
            <p>
                Only two. The studio is led by Pol (QuietPollen), with both collaborators sharing
                creative responsibilities across narrative and conceptual development.
            </p>

            <h3>Why does the studio not reveal the real identities of its members?</h3>
            <p>
                Because privacy and security are core values of the studio. Public-facing roles
                and aliases are used without exposing personal or identifying information.
            </p>

            <h3>What is the purpose of the studio?</h3>
            <p>
                To create horror experiences that respect the player, encourage reflection and
                leave lasting emotional impact.
            </p>

            <h3>Does the studio plan to work only with horror?</h3>
            <p>
                At present, the focus is on narrative horror. However, the studio’s creative
                philosophy allows for the exploration of other genres in the future, as long as
                they maintain narrative depth and a strong authorial identity.
