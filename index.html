    <h1>Foxwell Collective Interactive</h1>

    <p>
        Foxwell Collective Interactive is an independent Brazilian indie game studio dedicated to
        the creation of narrative-driven and atmospheric interactive experiences. The studio was
        formed with the intention of exploring storytelling, emotional tension and immersive worlds
        through interactive media.
    </p>

    <p>
        The studio operates with a strong focus on creative consistency, long-term vision and
        meaningful development processes rather than fast production cycles or trend-oriented
        design choices. Every project is approached with care, iteration and attention to detail.
    </p>

    <p>
        Foxwell Collective Interactive is operated by two developers under the age of 18. All
        activities, public communication, project decisions and external interactions are
        supervised and supported by legal guardians to ensure compliance with applicable laws and
        platform requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our goal is to create experiences that feel intentional, cohesive and emotionally grounded,
        where atmosphere, narrative and gameplay work together rather than existing as isolated
        elements.
    </p>

    <h2>Studio Structure</h2>

    <p>
        The studio is publicly represented by <strong>Pol</strong>, also known as
        <strong>QuietPollen</strong>, who acts as the Lead Developer and primary coordinator of the
        project. Pol focuses on technical development, narrative structure, gameplay systems design
        and overall project organization.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to technical responsibilities, Pol also oversees public communication, manages
        official studio accounts and ensures that all shared information aligns with internal
        guidelines and long-term creative goals.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second core developer contributes actively to visual design, concept art and the overall
        aesthetic identity of the project. This includes visual storytelling, mood definition and
        maintaining artistic consistency across the experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        Due to age-related platform restrictions, this developer does not maintain public or
        official social media accounts at this time. Despite this limitation, their creative work
        remains essential to the project and continues uninterrupted.
    </p>

    <p>
        All creative contributions are valid, protected and recognized internally. Public presence
        is not a requirement for creative impact within the studio.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Project</h2>

    <p>
        Foxwell Collective Interactive is currently developing a narrative-focused project within
        the Mascot Horror genre. The project prioritizes psychological tension, environmental
        storytelling and emotional immersion rather than explicit or graphic content.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project’s universe, characters and foundational concepts were developed over a long
        period prior to the studio’s public formation. Many ideas existed in written form long
        before active development began.
    </p>

    <p>
        The narrative has undergone multiple significant revisions, including major structural
        changes, tone adjustments and conceptual refinements. This process lasted nearly a year
        and allowed the story to mature naturally.
    </p>

    <p>
        Development is intentionally paced to allow reflection, iteration and creative stability.
        The estimated release window is between <strong>2026 and 2027</strong>, ensuring sufficient
        time for polish and consistency.
    </p>

    <h2>Studio Philosophy</h2>

    <p>
        Foxwell Collective Interactive believes that effective horror and tension are created
        through atmosphere, pacing and emotional consequence rather than shock value alone.
    </p>

    <p>
        Writing, visual design, sound and gameplay systems are developed together as interconnected
        components of a single experience. No element exists in isolation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The studio values intentional design decisions, long-term identity and creative coherence
        over immediate visibility or short-lived trends.
    </p>

    <h2>Curiosities & Background</h2>

    <p>
        The studio logo references a central character that will appear in the first chapter of the
        current project, serving as a subtle narrative connection.
    </p>

    <p>
        The studio’s typography went through multiple redesigns and refinements before reaching its
        current visual identity.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project existed conceptually long before the studio’s public presence, evolving through
        notes, drafts and narrative experiments.
    </p>

    <p>
        The name <strong>QuietPollen</strong> was inspired by another independent developer admired
        by the studio, known publicly as <strong>UniqueGeese</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Inspirations include Bendy and the Ink Machine, Poppy Playtime, Indigo Park, Five Nights at
        Freddy’s and similar narrative-focused interactive works.
