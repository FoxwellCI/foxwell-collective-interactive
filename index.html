            <p>
                Foxwell Collective Interactive is an independent game studio operated by two main
                owners, working collaboratively across all areas of development.
            </p>

            <p>
                All creative decisions are discussed and shaped together. Narrative, gameplay,
                art direction and atmosphere are developed through shared iteration rather than
                isolated roles.
            </p>

            <p>
                While both owners actively contribute to every part of the project, each brings
                stronger expertise in specific areas.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Pol</strong>, publicly known as <strong>QuietPollen</strong>, serves as the
                Lead Developer and focuses primarily on technical development, narrative structure,
                systems design and overall project coordination.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>HushPetal</strong> is the second main owner and specializes in visual design,
                concept art, visual storytelling and maintaining the project’s aesthetic and
                atmospheric consistency.
            </p>

            <p>
                Team members may use official or semi-official social media accounts to share
                behind-the-scenes content, development thoughts and subtle hints about future
                projects. These accounts do not display sensitive personal information and must
                follow internal studio guidelines.

            <h2>Current Project</h2>
            <p>
                The studio currently has a narrative-driven project in active development, with
                its universe, characters and core gameplay concepts already defined.
            </p>

            <p>
                The project belongs to the Mascot Horror genre, focusing on psychological tension,
                emotional immersion and character interaction rather than explicit violence.
            </p>

            <p>
                The estimated release window is between 2026 and 2027, allowing adequate time for
                refinement, polish and creative consistency.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Studio Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                Foxwell Collective Interactive believes that impactful horror emerges from
                atmosphere, pacing and narrative consequences rather than shock value alone.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each project is treated as an authorial experience, where writing, visual design,
                sound and interactivity are developed together to support a cohesive vision.

            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <h3>How is the studio structured?</h3>
            <p>
                Foxwell Collective Interactive operates as a collaborative studio. Both main
                owners participate in all creative decisions while focusing on areas where they
                are most effective.
            </p>

            <h3>Who runs the studio?</h3>
            <p>
                The studio is run by two main owners. Pol (QuietPollen) leads technical development
                and narrative structure, while HushPetal leads visual design and concept art. Both
                collaborate closely across all aspects of development.
            </p>

            <h3>Why do team members use aliases?</h3>
            <p>
                Aliases allow public interaction without exposing sensitive personal information.
                The focus remains on creative work and the studio’s output.
